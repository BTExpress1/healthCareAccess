# Project Overview
This repository presents a data science project focused on Healthcare Access for African Americans. The goal is to identify disparities in access to care and provide actionable insights to improve health equity across communities.

# Repository Structure and Notes
Cookiecutter Template
This repository was scaffolded using the cookiecutter data science template (https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). As a result, some folders (e.g., models/, notebooks/, references/) may appear empty—they are part of the standard structure but were not used in this project.

# Data Exploration
During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, multiple datasets were reviewed. The final dataset was selected because it best aligned with the project's objectives, especially around race and access to healthcare services.

# Final Version vs Original
To ensure clarity and focus, only the relevant components of the analysis are retained in this version. Some preliminary work that did not directly support the project’s goals has been removed. However, the original repository with all earlier work remains intact and can be referenced separately.

# Modeling Approach
Given the complexity of the healthcare access problem and the nature of the data, I recognized early on that traditional models like linear or logistic regression would be insufficient. However, I implemented a basic version of logistic regression to establish a performance baseline before moving on to more sophisticated modeling techniques.

# Dataset Citation
The final analysis is based on the 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Adult File. The dataset was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS):
